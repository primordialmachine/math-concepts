\chapter{Synopsis}
C++ 17 library providing trigonometric functors.
The library is made available publicly on
\href{\GetLibraryRepository}{Github}
under the
\href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/LICENSE}{MIT License}.

\chapter{Requirements}
If the library is added to a project, then one needs to add the Primordial Machine libraries
\href{https://github.com/primordialmachine/errors}{Errors}
and
\href{https://github.com/primordialmachine/functors}{Functors}
as well.

\chapter{Limitations and Restrictions}
The library officially only supports Visual Studio 2017 and Windows 10.

%\section{Introductory example}
%Examples are located in the \href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/examples}{examples} directory.

\chapter{Library Interface Documentation}

\section{\texttt{namespace primordialmachine}}
The namespace this library is adding its declarations/definitions to.
The added namespace elements are documented below.

\input{functors}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\texttt{sin\_functor} (struct)}
A \textit{UnaryFunctorBase} which computes the
sine
of an angle.
The first parameter is the angle, the return value the sine of that angle.

%\noindent{}This library provides specializations of this functor for all floating point types.
%The specializations assume the angle is measured in radians.\\

\noindent{}\textcolor{orange}{\textit{Defect: No error/exception specification is provided.}}

\subsection{\texttt{sin} (function)}
A function which returns the value of \texttt{primordialmachine::sin\_functor\textlangle T\textrangle}
for a value of type \texttt{T}.

\noindent{}Possible implementations
\begin{verbatim}
template<typename T>
auto sin(const T& v) -> decltype(sin_functor<T, void>()(v))
{ return sin_functor<T, void>()(v); }
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{}\textcolor{orange}{\textit{Defect: No error/exception specification is provided.}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\texttt{cos\_functor} (struct)}
A \textit{UnaryFunctorBase} which computes the
cosine
of an angle.
The first parameter is the angle, the return value the cosine of that angle.
